      <h2><a href="https://wordpress.com/post/moviebuffsblogs.wordpress.com/22">Pawsitive Vibes: Unearthing 'Arthur the King'</a></h2>
      <div class="blog-content">
<p></p>
        This week, I had the pleasure of watching "Arthur the King," and I must say, it earned two enthusiastic thumbs up from me! However, I found myself eagerly awaiting the movie's conclusion, not for the reasons you may think, but because it stirred up unexpected feelings about my own furry friend waiting for me at home. How could I leave my loyal companion behind while I indulged in a burrito bowl and a captivating film!
      </p>
   <p>
When it comes to movies based on true stories, they often succeed because of the inherently engaging nature of the story. "Arthur the King" certainly delivered in this aspect. Yet, as is customary for me, I found myself immediately drawn to the real-life events behind the story. Questions how they got the dog into America, how the dog followed them the entire way, why there was an immediate connection to this dog and not the others. Nevertheless, I recognize that such curiosity is precisely why stories based on true events intrigue us, and in that regard, both the movie and its narrative left me thoroughly satisfied.
</p>
<p>
"Arthur the King" provided a welcome departure from the mundane, offering a dose of inspiration and big dreams. From its breathtaking scenery to the exhilarating competitions and the bonds of love and companionship depicted, the film left me ready for future adventures, including my instant google search to find a 5K with my own dog, Moose (not yet ready for the level of running a five-day race on a couple hours of sleep). I acknowledge I am a sucker for the uplifting theme of self-discovery in the middle of adversity, of daring to dream big and taking risks, and this movie embodied those sentiments flawlessly.
</p>
<p>
As we approach the second quarter of 2024, the year still feels fresh and ripe with possibilities. For anyone feeling adrift or uncertain about their goals, "Arthur the King" serves as a reminder to embrace life's challenges and pursue our aspirations with unwavering determination. It's a cinematic experience that's sure to leave you feeling motivated and ready to get back to life.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, I can confidently declare that "Arthur the King" boasts high rewatchability. I've already recommended it to my parents and friends, and I wouldn't hesitate to revisit the theater for another viewing.

        <h2><a href="https://wordpress.com/post/moviebuffsblogs.wordpress.com/20">From Deadpool to Drama: Stephen's Movie Watchlist for the Year 2024</a></h2>
        <div class="blog-content">

          <ol class="blog">
            <li>Deadpool 3 (July)</li>
            <li>It Ends With Us (February)</li>
            <li>IF (May)</li>
            <li>King Foo Panda 4 (March)</li>
            <li>The Fall Guy (May)</li>
            <li>A Quiet Place: Day 1 (June)</li>
            <li>Civil War (April)</li>
            <li>Inside out 2 (June)</li>
          </ol>

            <p>
2024 is officially the year of the Man Crush Cinema! Three of the top movies are started by Ryan Reynolds. Well, “It Ends With Us” is actually starred by his wife, Blake Lively. It is on the list mainly because my wife is on a Colleen Hoover reading spree and I’m interested to see if the story line is worth all the hype. "The Fall Guy" secures a spot thanks to Ryan Gosling's exceptional performance in Barbie, which to me was unexpectedly an instant classic and maybe the best movie of 2023. He stole the show, leaving me excited to witness his next move – surely this will not be a miss!
</p>
<p>
Heck go ahead and add Jack Black to the list of movies that are anticipated because of him being considered a man crush! Additionally, John Krasinski returns for the third installment in the Quiet Place series, though there's a bit of worry because the previous two were very much enjoyable.
</p>
<p>
Closing the list are movies I'll watch but won't be storming the doors on opening day: Civil War and Inside Out. The latter holds a special place in my heart, resonating from when my parents took me to see the first movie before my freshman year in college. I'm hoping the sequel evokes the same emotional attachment, though beating Bing Bong's "take her to the moon" line will be a challenge.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I'm optimistic about discovering some dark horse movies that may have slipped under my radar. Anticipating only eight movies for an entire year might make it feel like a drag, so here's to hoping for some hidden gems.

      <h2><a href="https://wordpress.com/post/moviebuffsblogs.wordpress.com/18">The Nolan Spectrum: Ranking and Analyzing Oppenheimer Among His Best</a></h2>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <p>

          While we're a bit behind on discussing Oppenheimer, released almost a year ago, it's never too late to delve into the works of the best director of this generation! Plus we decided that the Nolan Peloton headline, as silly as it is, gave us an excuse to bring our rankings up!

        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, Oppenheimer was an impressive movie that had Austin scouring the greater Memphis area for its 4K copy on Black Friday. However, it barely secures a spot in our top 5 Nolan films.
          </p>
          
         
         <h3> Stephen:</h3>
         <ol class="blog">
          <li>The Dark Knight</li>
         <li> Interstellar</li>
          <li>The Dark Knight Rises</li>
          <li>Inception</li>
         <li> Oppenheimer</li>
        </ol>
         <p>
          First off, I am an obvious fan of serious storytelling and a sucker for the ending of a trilogy, Nolan's Batman movies claim two spots! The greatest scene in cinematic history, Bane and Batman's sewer fight with the iconic line, “Ah, you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!” showcases Nolan's ability to cast memorable villains like the Joker and Bane. While 4 and 5 could be debated, Inception's thought-provoking nature and the resulting in-depth conversations give it a slight edge over Oppenheimer which fell in as number 5 for me.
          </p>
          
          <br>
          <h3>Zach:</h3>
          <ol class="blog">
         <li> The Dark Knight</li>
        <li>  Inception</li>
         <li> Interstellar</li>
         <li> The Prestige</li>
         <li> Oppenheimer</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         I really liked it but I don't think it's just a masterpiece tbh. I might be in the minority on that but he's my favorite director and all his movies are masterpieces. 
         I'd say 5 is a good spot, but to me I loved Batman begins too so this is tough. All his films are top tier so there's really no wrong list. But to me 5 is a safe spot for it, it could move a little higher after I rewatch. <br>
         Regarding Dunkirk that didn’t fall in anyone’s top 5, I liked it but it wasn't my favorite. I think it needed more dialogue. I loved how he Intercut the different areas of fighting but there was just so much visually that some breaks with more dialogue would've been good. It was still a good movie though just not as rewatchable to me. I liked 1917 a lot more. 
          </p>
          
          <br>
          <h3>Austin:</h3>
          <ol class="blog">
          <li>Inception</li>
         <li>Interstellar</li> 
         <li> The Prestige</li>
          <li>The Dark Knight</li>
         <li> Oppenheimer</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I appreciate Oppenheimer as a top-tier movie. Inception gets a boost for Leo's presence, and I, agree with Zach's praises The Prestige as potentially Nolan's best all-around film. The Dark Knight ranks lower due to the belief that the standout element is The Joker rather than Nolan's overall filmmaking brilliance. Although, Nolan might be the best director of all time.
